== Description == 

Simple Feed Customizer is use in customizing WordPress feed such as adding a read-more link at the end of a Summary feed, adding copyright text at the bottom of each feed item, and including feature image to each and every feed post.

I built this plugin in order to deter scrapers who were constantly a torn in my flesh stealing my blog articles via some [special kind of software]( http://tech4sky.com/simple-feed-customizer-wordpress-plugin/) that rip-off RSS feed.
